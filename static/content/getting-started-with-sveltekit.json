I recommend selecting the following options:\n\n- SvelteKit demo app\n- TypeScript\n- ESLint, Prettier, and Playwright for testing\n\nOnce the project is created, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd my-blog\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Creating Blog Posts\n\nNow you can create blog posts using Markdown. Create a new file in the `src/content/blog` directory with a `.md` extension.\n\nHere's an example of a blog post:\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: My First Blog Post\ndate: '2023-01-01'\n---\n\n# My First Blog Post\n\nThis is my first blog post!\n\n## Heading 2\n\nSome content here...\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSvelteKit makes it easy to build a blog with Markdown support. With a proper content management system, you can write your blog posts in Markdown and include rich content.\n\nIn future posts, I'll cover more advanced topics like adding a CMS, implementing search functionality, and deploying your blog to production.\n\nStay tuned!\n",
